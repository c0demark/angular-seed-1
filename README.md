Angular-seed
============

An AngularJS project seed which aims to keep it simple.

* [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) as a http server (optional)
* Gulp as task runner
* Bower for managing front-end assets
* Sass for styles
* Plain JavaScript (Maybe ES6 in the future)
* NPM is only used for satisfying Gulp dependencies
