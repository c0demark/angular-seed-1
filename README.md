Angular-seed
============

An AngularJS project seed which aims to keep it simple.

* [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) as a http server (optional)
* Gulp as task runner
* Bower for managing front-end assets
* Sass for styles
* Plain JavaScript (Maybe ES6 in the future)
* NPM is only used for satisfying Gulp dependencies


Usage
-----

* gulp - by default runs the development tasks

* gulp prod - build app for production
* gulp dev  - build app for development - compile assets, compile app, start server, watch for changes

* gulp assets - only compile assets
* gulp app - only compile app files
* gulp serve - starts a web server on `localhost:2020`
* gulp watch - watches scripts for changes
